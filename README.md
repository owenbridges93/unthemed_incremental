# Unthemed Incremental

> This is a game with a basic UI that is meant to capture the 
> mechanics that first made incremental/idle games so enjoyable.

> The batch file extension (obviously) isn't compatible with 
> operating systems that arent Windows, so running the program 
> on other operating systems is as easy as typing
> "python3 game.py" in your console.

## Have fun and please report it if you find bugs!
