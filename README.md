# Unthemed Incremental

> [This](https://github.com/owenbridges93/unthemed_incremental) is a game with a basic UI that is 
> meant to capture/reimagine the mechanics that first made incremental/idle games so enjoyable.

> The batch file extension (obviously) isn't compatible with 
> operating systems that arent Windows, so running the 
> program on other operating systems is as easy as typing
> "python3 game.py" in your console.

> As this game is currently work in progress, I have a few ideas to 
> substantially change both the frontend and backend of the game.

## Have fun and please report it if you find bugs!
